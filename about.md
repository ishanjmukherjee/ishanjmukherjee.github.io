I am a sophomore at [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) majoring in computer science. I have done machine learning safety engineering at [ARENA](https://www.arena.education/), AI governance research at the [Cambridge Existential Risks Initiative](https://erafellowship.org/), and charity evaluations at [SoGive](http://sogive.org/#home). Outside work, I’m interested in the history of science and technology, AI, finance, cities, and biology.

Some quotes I like:

> 
> 1. Use mathematics as a short-hand language, rather than as an engine of inquiry. 
> 
> 2. Keep to them till you have done. 
>
> 3. Translate into English. 
> 
> 4. Then illustrate by examples that are important in real life. 
> 
> 5. Burn the mathematics. 
> 
> 6. If you can't succeed in 4, burn 3. 
> 
> 7. This last I did often.

> Cooking professionally is hard work. Writing is a privilege and a luxury. Anybody who whines about writer’s block should be forced to clean squid all day.
