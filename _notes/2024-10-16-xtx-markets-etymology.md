Why is [XTX Markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XTX_Markets), Alex Gerko's quantitative trading firm, so named? I realized today that it's probably in honor of the $X^TX$ in the closed-form solution for linear regression:

$$\beta = (X^T X)^{-1}X^Ty$$

Linear regression is, of course, ubiquitous in quantitative trading.

Fun aside: XTX Markets [opened](https://www.ft.com/content/a9989e23-3033-4ff9-97dc-815f360a6955) a huge data center in Finland earlier this year. In building its own data center, XTX bucks the trend set by Citadel Securities, which rents Google supercomputer time. The linked *Financial Times* article has a cool throwaway comment abot the data center ecosystem in Nordic countries:

> Space in data centres around Europe is tight, with demand far outstripping supply, according to a survey in February by real estate company CBRE. Last year European supply increased 10 per cent to 561MW, the company said. Nordic countries are popular locations for hosting data centres, because of their cheap electricity and cold climates which means there is less need to cool servers down. Earlier this year Google said it was building a 240MW data centre in Norway.

Around the time this article was published, *FT* published another story about the Japanese ceramics maker [Maruwa](https://www.ft.com/content/250bc888-a55f-405d-ad16-b4f17f144cb4), which saw its stock double over the past year because its porcelain manufacturing expertise can be used to cool AI data centers. Maruwa stock is still [going strong](https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=5344:TYO). Quants will optimize every dollar out of the system --- consider Michael Lewis's story in [*Flash Boys*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Boys) about the fiber-optic cable that was bored through a *mountain* to keep latency times low (this story was [movie-fied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hummingbird_Project)).

By the way, if you're looking for a name for your firm that doesn't have a sensible expansion but still a cool backstory, consider ATG: the nucleotide sequence encoding "start".
