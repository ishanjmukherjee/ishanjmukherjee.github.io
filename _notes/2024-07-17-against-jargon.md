Amanda Askell’s blog post “[Against jargon](https://www.askell.blog/against-jargon/)” is great. One of the reasons to avoid jargon is that it gives undue credibility to ideas. For example, “if people do it, they must be doing it for a reason” sounds like a banal thought that would be laughed out of most intellectual discussions. But call this idea Chesterton’s fence and it takes on a force of its own. The only thing that’s been added is a British name and some loose analogy to finding a fence in a desert.
