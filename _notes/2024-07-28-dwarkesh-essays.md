[Dwarkesh Patel](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/) was wondering in a recent [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm49oIPtyRE) whether he should write essays synthesizing the research he does in preparation for each interview. I think he should; heâ€™d be [commoditizing the complement](https://gwern.net/complement) to his interviews (the complement to his interviews is background knowledge necessary for understanding what his guests are talking about). For example, I am unsure I will understand much of his upcoming Dylan Patel episode; a writeup would help.
