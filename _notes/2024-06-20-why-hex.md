There's interesting motivation for the hexadecimal system from *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective*:

> Neither \[binary nor decimal\] notation is very convenient for describing bit patterns. Binary notation is too verbose, while with decimal notation it is tedious to convert to and from bit patterns. Instead, we write bit patterns as base-16, or *hexadecimal numbers*.

Of course, itâ€™s not so hard to convert a single hex character into the 4-digit binary representation --- you could even commit the conversions to memory.
