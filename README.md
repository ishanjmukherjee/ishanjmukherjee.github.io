# Personal website

I created this website mainly to host my blog posts, after getting frustrated with [Substack](https://decisiontree.substack.com/)'s lack of inline math rendering and syntax higlhighting or backtick-demarcation for code snippets/blocks. To spend as little time on this as possible, I used Jekyll and the default GitHub Pages hosting option. 

To do, in rough order of priority:

- [ ] Add tagging for posts, especially the `technical` tag.
- [ ] Add a now page.
- [ ] Add a projects page.
- [ ] Add a CV.
- [ ] Add a posts page to the navbar that redirects to the home page.
- [ ] Remove the repeated "Ishan Mukherjee" at the footnote; it looks monumentally silly.
- [ ] Add an email signup button for posts. Lots of people don't use RSS.
- [ ] Add my picture to the About page.
- [ ] Add a workflow where I don't have to upload images to a subdirectory. The ideal would be `ctrl-v`ing images. 
- [ ] Add automatic dating for posts, or at least a keyboard shortcut for entering the date on VS Code (or whatever editor).
- [ ] Add auto-centering for images.
