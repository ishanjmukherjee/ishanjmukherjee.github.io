I am a sophomore at [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) majoring in computer science. I have done machine learning safety engineering at [ARENA](https://www.arena.education/), AI governance research at the [Cambridge Existential Risks Initiative](https://erafellowship.org/), and charity evaluations at [SoGive](http://sogive.org/#home).
