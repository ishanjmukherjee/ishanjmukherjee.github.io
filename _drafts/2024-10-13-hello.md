This is my first day using Jekyll. If Substack had $\LaTeX$ and `code` support, this day would never come.

$$e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0$$

is an overrated equation, but a correctly rated test for MathJax. Constant rendering, exponentation, and the equality sign -- what's not to like?

Some syntax-highlighted Python:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

Some syntax-highlighted C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
  return 0;
}
```
