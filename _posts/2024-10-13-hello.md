This is my first day using Jekyll. If Substack had $\LaTeX$ and `code` support, this day would never come.

$$e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0$$

is an overrated equation, but a correctly rated test for MathJax. Constant rendering, exponentation, and the equality sign -- what's not to like?

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

Syntax highlighted code blocks are bliss!
